# Apper 

Frontend for Apper project. Watch it working here - https://apper.vercel.app (viewing from Desktop recommended)

Interface is on Russian - unfortunately, I forgot to use English everywhere :joy:

Backend is not working. 

Backend repo available here: https://github.com/reetou/apperback

This is a simulator for building mobile apps inside your browser - and watch it updating realtime. 

You can drag'n'drop components inside red-bordered view and see how your component would look like in a real app. 
After saving changes on backend and triggering build you would get app archive (.apk for Android and .ipa for iOS) with exactly looking React Native app. 
Amazing. But didn't work out.

Start it:
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- Visit http://localhost:3000
